          <p>Have you ever asked the question, “What does it mean to BE a leader?” Most of us learn a set of leadership tactics (do this, don’t do that) and are then confused when these tactics don’t universally work the way we want them to! In Thrive Leadership we ask the question, <strong>"Who are you <em>being</em> while you’re doing what you’re doing?”</strong> We look at the character of our leadership in addition to our competence.</p>
          <p>This training will help you uncover your assumptions, beliefs and patterns; and examine how they are working both for and against the vision you have for your leadership.  As your trainers, we are committed to rigorously supporting you and standing for new possibilities in your life.</p>
